# Predicting Fuel Efficiency of Vehicles
Selecting and Training Models
1. Select and Train a few Algorithms(Linear Regression, Decision Tree, RandomForest)
2. Evaluation using Mean Squared Error
3. Model Evaluation using Cross Validation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
5. Check Feature Importance
6. Evaluate the Final System on test data
7. Saving the Model.


In this notebook, i developed a machine learning model which predicts the Fuel variable with multiple independent variables like engine size, Cylinders, HorsePower and more..,
This Notebook covers end-to-end machine learning project like 'data collection' to 'Model Development'.
